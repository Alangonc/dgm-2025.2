# 2025.2 IA376N - Project - Second Delivery - Checkpoint (E2)

## General Instructions

The overall objective of the final project for this course is to provide the opportunity to implement a generative model for multimodal signals (images, audio, text, health data, physiological signals, physical signals, etc.), using deep learning techniques.

In the second project delivery, your group must:

 - Create a tag release 2025.2_IA376_E2;  
 - Update the repository’s README.md file according to the guidelines provided below;  
 - Submit a new pull request;  
 - Prepare for a presentation of no more than 10 minutes about the current status of the project.  

In this second delivery, it is expected that the initially proposed theme has already been explored both theoretically and practically.  
As a result of this exploration, it is possible that you/your group have decided to change the scope of the project or have gained greater clarity about which of the initially proposed methods can actually be implemented. Such changes and the final objectives of the project are expected to be explicitly stated in this second delivery.  

## Guidelines for editing the project’s README.md file

For delivery E2, the repository’s README.md must be formatted in anticipation of the project’s final delivery format [according to the model provided at this link](https://github.com/teaching-FEEC/dgm-2025.2/blob/main/templates/E2-E3_template.md).  

## Repository Structure

In order to standardize the project repositories for this course, it is suggested that the repository directories be named according to the structure suggested in [Home - Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/), in the "Directory structure" section.  

Note that not all directories or files will be necessary for all projects. Focus on following the standard for the directories that are needed. Do not create directories that will not be used.  

Your repository must contain the README.md file, a Markdown documentation file, which should include the project description according to the guidelines provided above.
