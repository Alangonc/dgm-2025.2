## General Instructions

The overall objective of the final project for this course is to provide the opportunity to implement a generative model for multimodal signals (images, audio, text, health data, physiological signals, physical signals, etc.), using deep learning techniques.

In the final submission of your project, your group must:
 - Create a tag release 2025.2_IA376N_E3;  
 - Update the repository’s README.md file according to the guidelines provided below;  
 - Submit a new pull request;  
 - Prepare for the final 15-minute presentation about the project.  

## Guidelines for editing the project’s README.md file

For submission E3, the repository’s README.md must contain the sections outlined in the final project delivery model [available at this link](https://github.com/teaching-FEEC/dgm-2023.2/blob/main/templates/E2-E3_template.md).  

## Repository Structure

In order to standardize the project repositories for this course, it is suggested that the repository directories be named according to the structure suggested in [Home - Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/), in the "Directory structure" section.  

Note that not all directories or files will be necessary for all projects. Focus on following the standard for the directories that are needed. Do not create directories that will not be used.
