# 2025.2 IA376N – Project – First Delivery (E1)

## General Instructions

The overall goal of the final project for this course is to provide the opportunity to implement a generative model of multimodal signals (images, audio, text, health data, physiological signals, physical signals, etc.), using deep learning techniques.

In this first delivery, the group’s mission will be to set up its project repository, present its proposal by editing the repository’s `README.md` file, as well as to present the project proposal in class.

So, please follow these instructions carefully:
* Ensure that each team member has a GitHub account (each member’s contributions will be monitored).
* One team member must fork this repository and add the other members as collaborators of this new repository.
* In your fork, inside the `projects` folder, *create a new folder* with the *name of your project*.
* Commit the files related to this delivery, following the guidelines below:
  * when everything is ready for submission, create a release tag in your repository identified as `2025.2_dgm_E1`;
  * by the established submission date, create a pull request to this repository.

### Class Presentation
* Prepare a presentation of up to 10 minutes for your project proposal.
* The presentation will be held in class on the date specified in the course calendar. After the presentation, there will be a discussion of the proposal. During the discussion, feedback and suggestions for improvement will be provided.
* It is suggested to create a video for the presentation to be shown in class, so that the 10-minute limit is respected and all groups can present smoothly.
* It is not necessary for all team members to participate in the presentation. The most important aspect is the quality and objectivity of the presentation, while respecting the 5-minute time limit for presenting. However, if any team member is absent on the date of the discussion, a 50% penalty will be applied to the E1 grade.
* **IMPORTANT:** Include the link to the presentation slides in your project repository’s `README.md` file.

## Repository Structure

To standardize the course project repositories, it is suggested that the repository directories follow the structure recommended in [Home - Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/), under the section *"Directory structure."*

Note that not all directories or files will be necessary for every project. Focus on following the pattern for the directories that are relevant to your work. Do not create directories that will not be used.

Your repository must include the `README.md` file, a Markdown documentation file, which should describe the project according to the guidelines below.

## Guidelines for Editing the Project’s `README.md` File

The repository’s `README.md` file must be formatted [according to the template available at this link](https://github.com/teaching-FEEC/dgm-2025.2/blob/main/templates/E1-template.md).

If you have no prior experience with Markdown editing, refer to: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  
We also recommend using VSCode and extensions to support Markdown editing.

> Everything that appears in this blockquote mode refers to something that must be replaced with the indicated information (also remove the ">" symbol from the markdown).
